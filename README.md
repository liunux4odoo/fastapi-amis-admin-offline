# raw ECharts component for streamlit

A Streamlit component for the [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) library.

## Features

It has following advantages comparing to [Streamlit-echarts](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts):
- It is written in pure html/js without react/vue/webpack, no need to install nodejs when developping. It can also be used as template to write other html/js based component for traditional frontend-developpers.
- It supports raw ECharts api, i.e, useing "`new echarts.graphic.LinearGradient(...)`" as color in chart option.
- Benifit from ECharts design scheme, chart can be dynamiclly updated without remounted by specifying a key.
- It can returns the `chart.getDataURL()` as component value, so can easily save or download chart as picutre by code.
- It integrates basic ECharts libraries and map resources from [pyecharts-assets](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts-assets), so can be used in off-line environments.

Short conclusion: with this component, streamlit user can display any ECharts by setting params on the python side, no development on the frontend is necessary anymore.

## Install

1. `pip install streamlit-raw-echarts`
2. basic charts and 3D charts already be available with a fresh installation. If additional geo map needed, user can:
    - download [pyecharts-assets](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts-assets) zipball, then copy pyecharts-assets/assets folder to {streamlit_raw_echarts installation folder}/frontend/. This repo contains maps of lots countries.
    - pass custome geo json data to component your self.

## Usage examples
```python
from streamlit_raw_echarts import st_echarts

option={
    'tooltip':{
        'trigger':'item',
    },
    'visualMap':{},
    'series':[
        {
            'type':'map',
            'mapType':'world',
            'label':{'show':False},
            'roam':True,
            'data':[
                {'name':'China','value':1500},
                {'name':'USA','value':2000},
                {'name':'Brazil','value':1000},
            ]
        }
    ]
}

chart=st_echarts(option=option,key='echarts1')
st.write(chart[:50])
```

## API
The APIs are similar with [Streamlit-echarts](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts).

Additional parameters:
- notMerge/lazyUpdate: passed to chart.setOption, whether merge the option or not.
- returnData: dict with values same to chart.getDataURL(), will set chart's image data as component value. Be careful this will slows down your app.

## Further development
User can add any params to `frontend/index.html.updateChart`, then pass params through st_echarts.
